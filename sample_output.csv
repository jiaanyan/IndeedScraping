Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a complete set of cloud services that enable all companies, from startups to enterprises, to run virtually everything in the cloud, including mobile applications, big data analytics, AI/ML platforms, and microservices/serverless infrastructures. Startups, which are now primarily born-in-the-cloud, represent a critically important and growing subset of customers to AWS. Startups have unique needs, priorities, and growth trajectories, that distinguish them from traditional businesses and require different engagement strategies and sales motions from seller teams to effectively acquire, grow, and retain them on the AWS platform.

Canada is the 4th largest Startup ecosystem in the world and 3rd in Generative AI funding. The AWS Startups team in Canada has local coverage across major cities (including bilingual teams in Quebec) with specialized focus on AI, FinTech, ISVs, ClimateTech, and Healthcare and Life Sciences.

We are seeking a Senior Account Manager to manage National coverage for a set of approximately 30 B2B and B2C Startups.

In this role, you will develop a territory strategy and account plans that enable you to build and maintain senior customer relationships, develop and manage sales opportunities, and lead a team of extended resources within this fast-past and evolving customer set. You will maintain a strong working relationship with the AWS senior leadership team to support initiatives with your customers. You will apply your knowledge of evolving industry and startup ecosystem trends to provide thought leadership and AWS-led solutions to help your Startup customers grow and scale.

To be successful in this role you need to be passionate about startups, the Canadian startup ecosystem, and be a self-starter with an entrepreneurial spirit (a builder!) who is prepared to work in a fast-paced environment, execute against ambitious goals, and consistently embrace the Amazon Culture.

Key job responsibilities
Accelerate customer adoption of AWS through a well-developed territory plan and detailed account plans that encompass sales and go-to-market strategies
Drive market share while exceeding both revenue and non-revenue goals
Lead engagement with Founders, CxOs, Board of Directors, and Venture Capital influencers
Partner with internal cross-functional teams across Solutions Architecture, Business Development, Marketing, Partners, and others
Identify ways for AWS to add value to your startups and help them grow beyond just providing great infrastructure services and support
Work with Partners to extend reach and drive adoption.
Develop long-term strategic relationships within your accounts
Ensure customer satisfaction
Expect moderate travel across Canada to meet in-person with customers, and to the U.S. for briefings and events
